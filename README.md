# portfolio
my portfolio should load with no issues and contains my name and links that route to my summary work and contact information.
included for the imagery is a non-copyright photo of a galaxy in which i used as my theme.
the links in the navigation work to route the user to the correct section.
when scrolling over each assignment, you should find that the transition enlarges the image on the focused assignement.
